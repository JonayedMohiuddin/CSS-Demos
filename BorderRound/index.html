	<h1>Round Corners Demo</h1>
	
	<p>The border-radius rule works by cutting an arc from each corner of the
	element. The arc has the specified radius, so for sharp corners, youâ€™ll want
	a small radius. You can measure the radius in any of the common measure-
	ments, but pixels (px) and character width (em) are the most commonly used.
	The border is not visible unless the element has the background-color
	or border defined. Note that there are variations of each tag to support
	specific corners: border-top-left-radius and so on. This can be useful
	if you do not wish to apply the same radius to all four corners of your ele-
	ment. The most recent browsers now support the generic border-radius
	rule. You can pick up a number of the previous-generation browsers by using
	the vendor-specific prefix. If your browser does not understand the border-
	radius rule, it will simply create the ordinary squared corners.</p>
