	<h1>Float Demo</h1>
	<p>
		Paragraph 1.
		This paragraph has the normal behavior of a block-level element.
		It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next element
		is placed underneath.
	</p>
	<p class="floated">
		Paragraph 2.
		This paragraph is floated left. It is placed to the left, and the
		next element will be placed to the right of it.
	</p>
	<p class="right">
		Paragraph 3.
		This paragraph has no floating, width or margin. It takes whatever
		space it can to the right of the floated element, and then flows
		to the next line.
	</p>
