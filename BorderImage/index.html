	<h3>What’s up with the -moz and -webkit stuff?</h3>
	<p>As you look over the code for the image
	border demo, you’ll see three versions of
	the border-image rule: border-image,
	-webkit-border-image, and -moz-
	border-image. This is a pattern you’ll see
	on many of the newer CSS elements. While
	an element is still being finalized, some of
	the browser manufacturers will define a test
	version of the rule using a special browser-
	specific prefix.-webkit is the rendering
	image used in Chrome and Safari, and -moz
	is used by Firefox. Sometimes you’ll also see
	the -o prefix to indicate Opera, and -ms to
	represent Internet Explorer. You can always
	try the generic rule name, but for newer rules
	like image border, it’s also safe to include
	the vendor-specific versions. As acceptance
	of these newer rules becomes more wide-
	spread, the vendor prefixes will no longer be
	needed.</p>
