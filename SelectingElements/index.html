	<h1>Emphasis and Strong Emphasis (Modified by CSS)</h1>
	<p>This paragraph illustrates two main kinds of emphasis. <em>This sentence uses the em tag.</em>By default,
		emphasis is italic. <strong>This sentence uses strong emphasis.</strong>The default formatting of strong emphasis is bold. </p>
	<p>Of course you can change the formatting with CSS. This is a great example of <em>semantic</em>formatting. Rather than indicating the <strong>formatting</strong>of some text,
		you indicate <strong>how much it is emphasized.</strong></p>
	<p>This way,
		you can go back and change things,
		like adding color to emphasized text without the formatting commands muddying your actual text. </p>
  <p><strong>What’s funny about the following sentence?
     &lt;strong&gt; is always bold.
     Get it? That’s a bold-faced lie! Sometimes I crack myself up.</strong></p>
